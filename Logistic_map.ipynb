For different values of r (ranging from 2.4 and 4) and initial conditions (choosen at random between 0 and 1) plot the value of x after  after 1000 time steps on the y-axis and the corresponding value of r on the x-axis. Fell free to search for \"logistic map\" to find additonal information if necessary.\n",
